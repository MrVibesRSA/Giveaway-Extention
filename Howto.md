### Setup Instructions.
+ Firstly we need to create two new text files for the Giveaway actions to use, Where you save them is ultamatly up to you
  but for example sake and my choise I'll do so in the H:\Streamer.bot x64\data\ folder.
+ You can do so by right clicking  emty space in the folder and going to new and selecting New Text Document. Now you can call
  the one ListEntries and the other one ListWinners.
+ Example: ![alt text](img/2.png "image title")
+ Now that our file system is ready we can head over to Streamer.bot and finish up our setup with a few more steps.
+ Under "Giveaway - Setup : !giveawaysetup" Sub-Actions you will see two file locations we need to point to our newly
  created files.
